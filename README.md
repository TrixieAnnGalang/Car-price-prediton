# Car Price Prediction
This is a project that has the goal to predict the price of different cars. This dataset was uploaded from kaggle and the first thing I did was that I tried to analyze different features, cleaned the data (by removing different character inside my variables), and plotted some charts to see the perfomance of different features.
Furthermore, I transform all of the categorical variables into numerical ones to using onehot encoder to be able to peform some models such as Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest. with these model I have obtained the Mean Absolute Error.
Lastly, I perfomed chi2 for the feature selection to see if we can improve our model performance
