Car Price Prediction
This is my first project in Programming as a Data Science Student. This dataset was uploaded from kaggle and the first I did was that I tried to analyze different features, cleaned the data (by removing different character inside my variables), and plotted some charts to see the perfomance of different features.
furthermore, I transform all of the categorical variables into numerical ones to using onehot encoder to be able to peform some models such as Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest. with these model I have obtained the Mean Absolute Error.
